        <p>I lead the product and UX design of Alegion.com, and guide the research and product team through rapid iterations that have multiplied the B2B sales bookings in under 6 months. This is a look at how iterative design, regular testing, and innovative design thinking led to the continued success of the leading video data annotation platform in the world. This case study presents a meticulous implementation of my personal UX process, and an opportunity to see how it is practically applied. I believe in taking an approach to design that is deeply rooted in both theory and practice, and we can see those worlds collide here.

          <p>Alegion transforms unstructured data into high quality, model-ready training data through a team of data experts, AI-powered annotation services, and a skilled global workforce. We find ourselves at an intersection of AI and human work. As a result, the largest userbase is in people who train the data for AI to work on. Our clients bring us data in the form of images, video etc, and want it labelled to use for various purposes. For example, in this grocery store scene, our platform can be used to label a person by drawing a bounding box around it, and then choosing a subclassification, such an associated hand. This labeled data can then be used by the clients for other purposes such as analysing performance patterns.</p>

          <br><br>

          <p>Until recently, most of the labeling was performed by largely human annotators, which means that workers, either on the client's teams, or our own, would go over each of the assets and create bounding boxes around entities and then classify it. We were able to enhance some of the features, such as, SmartPoly, using AI and computer vision, but these were limited usages. Our business model is B2B, so we attract clients and charge for using our platforms and deliver high quality annotations. </p>

          <h3 class = "h5">My approach</h3>

          <p>My process of end to end design work is rooted in my lean UX beliefs of multiple iterations of cycles of the same larger steps: think, make, check. In the first step of each iteration, I collect information about the problem, identify opportunities, compare with marketing standards. In the second step, I conduct brainstorming sessions, consider a plethora of potential solutions and build rapid prototypes in figma. In the third step, I test potential solutions with end users, software developers and subject matter experts. At the end of each cycle, I document my learnings, and repeat. </p>

          <h3>Part 1: Think</h3>


          <p>I began by learning more about the problem, where it stems from, documenting assumptions from various stakeholders, formultation the ideal case scenarios, and analysing user behavior. In each iteration, I would advocate for creative design thinking and reflection from prior iterations. I also wanted to understand more about how the underlying technology works, how well users rely on it, and what kind of biases the automatic models could be prone to. At large, these were the questions I sought answers to:</p>

          <p>I conducted various brainstorming sessions with our CTO, data scientists, product managers, and engineers and collected information about these factors. I also made sure that most of these sessions were recorded and noted the salient points of each meeting in a confluence page. Then I separated facts from assumptions and created scripts for verifying some of the assumptions from the core team by conducting semi-structured interviews with users, both internal (our global workflorce) and external (clients with in-house labeling teams).  </p>

          <p>In my interviews with the subject matter experts I learned that there are many third party models that can be used for automatic data lebeling. Amazon MXNet, Tensorflow Core, Google AutoML, are some of the popular tools that can be used and implemented. Each of these come with their own pros and cons, but some of the things that are widely similar in each of these models are that they are all fairly new in the game. Computer vision has made significant growth in the past few decades, but it still falls short on reducing human work significantly. Each of these also come with their specific implementation requirements and for our system to be recpetive to them. Lastly, it is important to note that most of these models, while not all that impressive charge a hefty fee for use, which increases exponentially. So our business needed to figure out cost-effective to make use of them and actually be more economical than the alternative. </p>

          <p>In my interviews with end users, I learned that they had very little faith in automated models. It stems both from experience with them and also a fear of becoming less effective that them. I spoke to over 12 end users and learned that their experience with automated models in the past has been bleak at best</p>

           <blockquote class="card bg-soft-primary border-0 text-center font-size-2 font-weight-medium text-lh-md p-5 my-5">
          "Those models work poorly. It costed me several seconds per annotation to fix their drawings. I could have started from scratch in lesser time."

          </blockquote>

          <p>In these interviews I learned that there were varied levels of education and experiences with between the individuals. I also learned that the eutopic understanding from my core team was far from the possible implementation, but only in few areas. As a result I started breaking down the parts of each annotation. There are largely 2 sections: localizations and classification. Based on these I started charting out the various ways that automation could be used, and collected feedback from each party again. The following are the top 3 options considered. </p>

          <h5> [OPTION 1]: Splitting the workflow into 2 sections: </h5>

          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./assets/img/dimages/splitting_2stages.png" alt="Image Description">
          <br><br>

          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./assets/img/dimages/async_workflow.png" alt="Image Description">

          <p>I walked through these proposed workflow by different stakeholders such as engineers, product managers, resaerch scientist, data services worker etc to get their individual inputs. I was able to collect their questiions, concerns, edits, etc to these workflows. These visualizations of workflows were fruitful starting points to deep discussions. </p>

          <p>The middle of each iteration included rapid prototyping and considering ALL possible solutions. I am an advocate of considering unicorn solutions: which means even including the most bizzare, and out-of-the-box solutions. My hope is that one of these solutions will be out of the world innovative, but I digress. In the making phase of this project I considered the interactive figma prototypes of each of the possible workflows considered in the Think phases.  </p>

          <p>The search of the unicorn solution can sometimes lead to an unscoped exploration, which can cost unlimited time and effort. So I try to swear by a few rules to keep my design direction guided. In each of the solution iterations, I followed my design principles that I use in every design project: </p> <br>

          <p>These principles helped rejected some solutions which worked functionally, but didn't make it to the top three ideas considered. They helped consider some ideas that would have been missed otherwise. They also helped bring some srtucture to the exploration.  </p> <br>

          <h5> [OPTION 1]: Splitting the workflow into 2 sections: </h5>
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./assets/img/dimages/cssl_option1.gif" alt="Image Description"><br><br><br><br><br><br>

          <h5> [OPTION 2]: Learning in sequence, finishing after each stage: </h5>

          <h5> [OPTION 3]: In task learning and model updates: </h5>
          <img class="img-fluid rounded" src="./assets/img/dimages/cssl_option3.gif" alt="Image Description"><br><br>

          <p> Each solution had their pros and cons. The first option requires the least from the user. It follows an abracadabra approach, where all the user has to do is click the auto-label button and all the localizations and classifications follow. The second approach allows the user to create the localizations, but most of the classifications is done by the AI model. After each task, tthe model is updated with the inputs from the user. This splits the effort between automation and human effort. The third option builds upon the second option, and while the localization is still performed by the human and most of the classification by the user, it reduces the effort of approving the correct classifications. This saves some of the human effort.</p>

          <h3>Part 3: Check</h3>

          <p>We tested each solution in two ways. The first way was conducting semi structured user testing, where I asked the users to perform a labeling task, while working with the intearctive figma prototypes. These sessions helped me fine tune some of the microinteractions. I also learned more about their levels of trust and opinions based on their prior experience. While the interviews involving figma interactions helped generate some insights, I recognized that this level of testing wasn't enough. So we built a proof of concept with existing data from a client.</p>
